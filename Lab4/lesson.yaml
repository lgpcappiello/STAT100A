  Output: We will begin today's lab by working through some conditional probability exercises. 
    Suppose 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly, and 78% like both. Given that a 
    randomly sampled person likes peanut butter, we want to find the probability that they also 
    like jelly.

- Class: text
  Output: Let J be the event that someone likes jelly and PB the event that someone likes peanut 
    butter.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How would we write the desired information in probability notation?
  CorrectAnswer: P(J | PB)
  AnswerChoices: P(J | PB); P(PB); P(J); P(PB and J); P(PB | J)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(J | PB)')
  Hint: We want to find the probability that someone likes jelly given that they like peanut butter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What information do we need in order to calculate this probability?
  CorrectAnswer: P(PB) and P(PB and J)
  AnswerChoices: P(PB) and P(PB and J); P(J) and P(PB and J); P(J) and P(PB); P(PB), P(J), and 
    P(PB and J)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(PB) and P(PB and J)')
  Hint: What's the formula for calculating a conditional probability?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find P(J | PB). Recall that 80% of people like peanut butter, 89% like jelly, and 78% 
    like both.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.78 / 0.80
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.975)
  Hint: It may be helpful to write the information from the problem statement in probability notation.
    For example, P(PB and J) = P(both) = 0.78
    
- Class: text
  Output: After an introductory statistics course, 80% of students can successfully construct box 
    plots. Of those who can construct box plots, 86% passed, while only 65% of those students who 
    could not construct box plots passed. We want to find the probability that a student is able 
    to construct a box plot if it is known that he passed.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which formula will we use to calculate this probability?
  CorrectAnswer: Bayes Theorem
  AnswerChoices: Bayes Theorem; conditional probability; addition rule; mutiplication rule
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Bayes Theorem')
  Hint: We know the probability that a student passed given that he can construct box plots. 
    We want to flip this around and find the probability that a student can construct box plots given 
    that he passed.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Let A be the event that a student passed the class. Let B be the event that a student can 
    construct box plots. 
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is our desired probability?
  CorrectAnswer: P(B | A)
  AnswerChoices: P(A and B); P(B); P(A); P(B | A)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(B | A)')
  Hint: We want to find probability that a student is able to construct a box plot if it is given 
    that he passed.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Let's write the information from the probability statement in our probability notation. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: P(B) = 0.80, P(A | B) = 0.86, P(A | not B) = 0.65
    
- Class: text
  Output: Bayes Theorem gives us a way to rewrite P(B | A) = P(A and B) / P(A).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by calculating P(A and B) = P(A | B)P(B). Find this value now.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.86 x 0.80
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.86*0.80)
  Hint: Look back to where we wrote our information out in probability notation.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to calculate P(A). Find this value now.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.80 × 0.86 + 0.20 × 0.65
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.80*0.86 + 0.20*0.65)
  Hint: Use the Law of Total Probability to calculate P(A). Remember that this is the sum of
    all of the joint probabilities where A occurs.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use these calculations to find P(B | A). Round your answer to 3 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.841
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.841)
  Hint: Plug your calculations back into Bayes Theorem. Then carefully round to 3 decimal places.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we pick three people at random. For each of the following questions, ignore the 
    special case where someone might be born on February 29th, and assume that births are evenly 
    distributed throughout the year. Recall that there are 365 days in a year.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that the first two people share a birthday? Enter your answer 
    as a fraction.
  CorrectAnswer: (365/365) x (1/365) = 1/365
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=1/365)
  Hint: The first person's birthday can be any day of the year. Then the second person's birthday must
    be on the specific day that the fist person's birthday falls on. What is the probability that 
    person 2's birthday is on a specific day?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that at least two of the three people share a birthday? Round to 3 
    decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 1 - (365/365)x(364/365)x(363/365) = 0.008
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.008)
  Hint: It may be easier to think of the probability that none of the people share a birthday and take
    the complement. Note that if my birthday is April 11, there is a 364/365 chance that you and I do 
    not share a birthday.

  Output: An airline charges the following baggage fees $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second. 
    Suppose 54% percent of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% percent have one piece of checked 
    luggage and 12% percent have two pieces. Assume nobody checks more than two bags.
    
- Class: text
  Output: We can set this up in probability notation. Let X be the amount of money spent to check bags.
    Zero bags costs $0, one bag costs $25, and two bags costs $25 + $35 = $60. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: P(no bags) = P(X = 0) = 0.54
  
- Class: text
  Output: P(one bag) = P(X = 25) = 0.34
  
- Class: text
  Output: P(two bags) = P(X = 60) = 0.12
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Compute the average revenue per passenger.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.54 x 0 + 0.34 x 25 + 0.12 x 60 = 15.7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=15.7)
  Hint: Double check the expected value formula from Section 3.4 or from the Aug 6 course notes.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the variance of the revenue per passenger.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.54 x (0-15.7)^2 + 0.34 x (25-15.7)^2 + 0.12 x (60-15.7)^2 = 398.01
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=398.01)
  Hint: Double check the variance formula from Section 3.4 or from the Aug 6 course notes.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the standard deviation of the revenue per passenger. Since these quantities are in 
    dollars, round your answer to 2 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(398.01) = 19.95
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=19.95)
  Hint: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Remember to round to 2 decimal 
    places.

    probabilities sum to 1.

  Output: What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than $50,000 
    per year?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.212 + 0.183 + 0.158 + 0.047 + 0.022 = 0.622
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.622)
  Hint: We want to include everyone who makes less than $50,000.
