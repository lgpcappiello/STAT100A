  Output: This week, we are talking about probability. So far, we've discussed general definitions
    and gotten started with conditional probability. Lab 3 will review some of these concepts and
    ask you to start computing basic probabilities.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Let's start simple. We talked a lot about rolling a six-sided die. Let A={3,4} be the event
    that we roll a 3 or a 4. Throughout this lab, we will enter probabilities as fractions. For example,
    to enter the probability that event A occurs, we could write 2/6 or simplify to 1/3.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try that now. Enter the probability that the event A occurs by typing either 1/3 or 
    2/6 and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 1/3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1/3)
  Hint: Type 1/3 and press Enter OR type 2/6 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's do another one. Let B={2,4,6} be the event that we roll an even number. Find P(B) 
    and type the fraction into R, then press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 1/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1/2)
  Hint: How many values are in B? How many possible rolls are there?
  
- Class: text
  Output: Roulette involves spinning a wheel with 38 total slots. These are broken down into 18 red, 
    18 black, and 2 green. A ball is spun onto the wheel and eventually lands in a slot. There is 
    an equal chance for each slot to capture the ball. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You watch a roulette wheel spin 3 consecutive times and each time the ball lands in a red slot.
    What is the probability that the ball will land on a red slot on the next spin?
  CorrectAnswer: 18/38
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 18/38)
  Hint: There are 18 red slots and 38 total slots.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are 5 questions on a multiple choice math exam. Each question has 4 choices and only one 
    correct answer. You give the exam to a monkey, who knows nothing about math and chooses answers at 
    random. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that the monkey gets the first question correct?
  CorrectAnswer: 1/4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1/4)
  Hint: There are 4 choices and only 1 correct answer.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that the first question the monkey gets correct is the 3rd question?
  CorrectAnswer: 9/64
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 9/64)
  Hint: Find the probabilty that the first question was incorrect AND the second question was incorrect
    AND the third question was correct. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that the monkey gets all of the five questions correct?
  CorrectAnswer: 1/1024
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1/1024)
  Hint: Find the probabilty that first is correct AND second is correct AND third is correct AND fourth 
    is correct AND fifth is correct. Remember that each question has 1 correct answer out of 4 possible
    choices.
    
- Class: text
  Output: For the next several questions, let A and B be independent events such that P(A)=0.2 
    and P(B)=0.8.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find P(A and B).
  CorrectAnswer: 0.16
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.16)
  Hint: Remember the multiplication rule for independent events! P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find P(A or B)
  CorrectAnswer: .8+.2-.16
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.84)
  Hint: Remember the addition rule! P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find P(A | B)
  CorrectAnswer: 0.2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.2)
  Hint: Remember that A and B are independent events.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Recall that the Law of Large Numbers is the tendency for an estimate to converge to the true
    value. We will demonstrate this using simulations.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We are going to simulate rolling a six-sided die. First, what is the probability that we roll
    a 6?
  CorrectAnswer: 1/6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1/6)
  Hint: There are six sides and only one side is a 6.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's simulate a single roll of the die. We do this by taking a single random sample of size 1
    from the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Type sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1)', 'sample(1:6, size=1)')
  Hint: Type sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We estimate the probability of rolling a 6 by taking the total number of times we rolled a 
    6 and dividing by the total number of rolls. We have one total roll. If you rolled a 6, the 
    current estimate is 1/1=1. If you did not roll a 6, the current estimate is 0/1=0.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's simulate another roll of the die. Type sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1)', 'sample(1:6, size=1)')
  Hint: Type sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We again estimate the probability of rolling a 6 by taking the total number of times we 
    rolled a 6 and dividing by the total number of rolls. Now we have two total rolls. If you 
    rolled two 6s, the current estimate is 2/2=1. If you rolled one 6 and one that was not a 6, the
    current estimate is 1/2. If both of your rolls were not 6s, the current estimate is 0/2=0.
    
- Class: text
  Output: We want to do this hundreds or even thousands of times to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers.
    Fortunately, we don't need to take one sample at a time the way we have been. We will take a sample 
    of size 1000, meaning that we will simulate rolling a six-sided die 1000 times. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: This time we will include "replace=TRUE" in our sample command. Think of this like drawing raffle tickets. 
    "Replace=TRUE" means that we put a raffle ticket back after it's been drawn so that we are able 
    to draw it multiple times. If we roll a die multiple times, we expect that at some point we will see
    the same number appear more than once. (If our first roll is a 1, it's possible for us to roll a 1
    again later.)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's do our simulation of 1000 rolls. We want to store this information so that we can
    easily calculate how many times we rolled a 6. Type rolls <- sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1000, 
    replace=TRUE) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: rolls <- sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1000, replace=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('rolls <- sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1000, replace=TRUE)', 
    'rolls <- sample(c(1:6), size=1000, replace=TRUE)')
  Hint: Type rolls <- sample(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), size=1000, replace=TRUE) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that we have 1000 rolls of our six-sided die, we want to count the number of times that we
    rolled a 6. We will ask R to check whether each roll is a 6 using some true/false logic. Type
    is6 <- rolls == 6 and press Enter. Be careful not to put a space between "is" and "6" in the variable 
    name and make sure to use TWO equal signs.
  CorrectAnswer: is6 <- rolls == 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='is6 <- rolls == 6')
  Hint: Carefully type is6 <- rolls == 6 and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to count how many times we rolled a six. Previously, we asked R to check for 6s. 
    R went through our rolls and entered TRUE (1) for 6 and FALSE (0) for everything else. Since all of 
    the TRUEs are saved as a 1, we can count the number of 6s by summing over our is6 variable. 
    Type sum(is6) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(is6)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(is6)')
  Hint: Carefully type sum(is6) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This is the total number of times we rolled a 6 in 1000 rolls!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to estimate the probability of rolling a six. We know that we did 1000 total rolls
    and we've already figured out how to count the total number of times we rolled a 6. Now all we need
    to do is divide the total number of times we rolled a 6 by the total number of rolls. Type 
    sum(is6)/1000 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(is6)/1000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(is6)/1000')
  Hint: Carefully type sum(is6)/1000 and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Recall that, when we did only two rolls, we got estimates like 0, 1/2, and 1 that were far from
    the true value of 1/6 = 0.1667. Your estimate should now be much closer to this value! If we repeated
    the previous few problems with 10000 or even 100000 rolls, we would get an even better estimate! 
    
- Class: figure
  Output: Now we are going to use the student survey data to examine probabilities with real data. I am 
    loading the data in behind the scences and building a contingency table in R.
  Figure: freqtab.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To view the table, type mytable and press Enter. Note that mytable is all one word.
  CorrectAnswer: mytable
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="mytable")
  Hint: Type mytable and press Enter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: For this class, are being a Sophomore and having a major in BCOE mutually exclusive?
  AnswerChoices: yes;no
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='yes')
  Hint: Is there any overlap between Sophomores and BCOE?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that a randomly selected CNAS student is a Junior?
  CorrectAnswer: 26/52
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 26/52)
  Hint: Find the number of CNAS students who are also Juniors out of the total number of CNAS students.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that a randomly student is a Senior OR is in CHASS?
  CorrectAnswer: (25/65)+(4/65)-(3/65)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.4)
  Hint: Find P(Senior) and P(CHASS). Then find P(Senior and CHASS) - remember not to double count 
    these students!
