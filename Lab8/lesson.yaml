  Output: Today we will be reviewing concepts from Chapter 5, including confidence intervals and thinking
    about hypothesis testing. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on 
    Twitter. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model 
    the sample proportion. We want to use this information to construct a 99% confidence interval.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is alpha, or our significance level, for the desired confidence interval? Make sure to enter
    this value as a decimal, NOT as a percent.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.01
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.01)
  Hint: Recall that confidence level = 1 - alpha.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can use alpha/2 to find the critical value. We will use one of our R functions for the normal
    distribution. Type qnorm(0.01/2) and press Enter. This will give us the negative version of our critical
    value z.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.01/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.01/2)')
  Hint: Type qnorm(0.01/2) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculate the margin of error for this confidence interval. Round your answer to three decimal 
    places.
  CorrectAnswer: MoE = z * SE = 2.58 * 0.024 = 0.062
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.062)
  Hint: Check the original problem statement for the standard error. What's our formula for margin of error?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use your margin of error to find the lower bound for the 99% confidence interval.
  CorrectAnswer: PE - MoE = 0.52 - 0.062 = 0.458
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.458)
  Hint: The lower bound will be point estimate - margin of error.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use your margin of error to find the upper bound for the 99% confidence interval.
  CorrectAnswer: PE - MoE = 0.52 + 0.062 = 0.582
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.582)
  Hint: The lower bound will be point estimate + margin of error.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great, if all went well, you found the interval (0.458, 0.582). Which is the best interpretation
    of this interval?
  CorrectAnswer: We can be 99% confident that 45.8% to 58.2% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least 
    some news on Twitter.
  AnswerChoices: We can be 99% confident that 45.8% to 58.2% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least 
    some news on Twitter.; We can be 95% confident that the true proportion is between 45.8% and 58.2%.;
    There is a 99% probability that the true proportion U.S. adult Twitter users who get at least 
    some news on Twitter is between 45.8% and 58.2%.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We can be 99% confident that 45.8% to 58.2% of U.S. adult Twitter users
    get at least some news on Twitter.')
  Hint: How do we interpret a confidence interval?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do we mean when we say 95% confident?
  CorrectAnswer: With repeated sampling, the true proportion will fall in our confidence intervals 95% of 
    the time.
  AnswerChoices: With repeated sampling, the true proportion will fall in our confidence intervals 95% of 
    the time.;There is a 95% probability that the true proportion falls in our confidence interval.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='With repeated sampling, the true proportion will fall in our confidence intervals 95% of 
    the time.')
  Hint: This is important! Double check your notes.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or false? The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of U.S. 
    adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter. Use a significance level of alpha = 0.01.
  CorrectAnswer: false
  AnswerChoices: true; false
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='false')
  Hint: Use the confidence interval you created in the previous problems.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or false? Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult 
    Twitter users were included in the study.
  CorrectAnswer: false
  AnswerChoices: true; false
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='false')
  Hint: What does standard error tell us?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or false? If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect 
    less data.
  CorrectAnswer: false
  AnswerChoices: true; false
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='false')
  Hint: Think carefully about the formula for standard error. What happens if we decrease our sample size?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: True or false? If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults 
    Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a 
    corresponding 99% confidence interval.
  CorrectAnswer: false
  AnswerChoices: true; false
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='false')
  Hint: If we want to be less confident, we won't need as many values in our interval. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made
    their visit because of a coupon they’d received in the mail. We will construct a 95% confidence interval
    for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they’d received 
    in the mail.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the point estimate for the proportion of shoppers whose visit was because of a coupon

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.05)
  Hint: Recall that confidence level = 1 - alpha.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can use alpha/2 to find the critical value. Use the qnorm function with your value for alpha/2
    to find the negative version of our critical value z.
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.05/2) = -1.96
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('qnorm(0.05/2)','qnorm(0.025)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(a/2), replacing a with the value of alpha.
  
- Class: cmd_question

    places.
  CorrectAnswer: MoE = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.0173 = 0.034
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.034)
  Hint: Recall we calculated the standard error above. What's our formula for margin of error?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use your margin of error to find the lower bound for the 99% confidence interval.

    of this interval?
  CorrectAnswer: We can be 95% confident that 20.1% to 26.9% of the store’s shoppers during the year 
    made their visit because they had received a coupon in the mail.
  AnswerChoices: We can be 95% confident that 20.1% to 26.9% of the store’s shoppers during the year 
    made their visit because they had received a coupon in the mail.; We can be 95% confident that the 
    true proportion is between 20.1% and 26.9%.; There is a 95% probability that the true proportion of 
    the store’s shoppers during the year made their visit because they had received a coupon in the mail is
    between 20.1% and 26.9%.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='We can be 95% confident that 20.1% to 26.9% of the store’s shoppers during the year made their visit because they had received a coupon in the mail.')
  Hint: How do we interpret a confidence interval?
  
- Class: text
  Output: We want to use the confidence interval to test whether the true proportion of the 
    store's shoppers that made their visit because they had received a coupon in the mail is 25%.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which is the correct way to write this question as a null and alternative hypothesis?
  CorrectAnswer: H0 p = 0.25 versus HA p =/= 0.25
  AnswerChoices: H0 p = 0.25 versus HA p =/= 0.25; H0 p =/= 0.25 versus HA p = 0.25; H0 p <= 0.25 versus
    HA p > 0.25; H0 p < 0.25 versus HA p => 0.25
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='H0 p = 0.25 versus HA p =/= 0.25')
  Hint: Think carefully about what we want to test.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your confidence interval, is there sufficient evidence at the 0.05 level of significance 
    to reject H0 and conclude that the true proportion of the store's shoppers that made their visit 
    because they had received a coupon in the mail is NOT 25%?
  CorrectAnswer: No, 0.25 is in the interval.
  AnswerChoices: No, 0.25 is in the interval.; Yes, 0.25 is in the interval.; Unknown, we cannot use this
    confidence interval to test at this level of significance.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No, 0.25 is in the interval.')
  Hint: How do we interpret a confidence interval?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your confidence interval, is there sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance 
    to reject H0 and conclude that the true proportion of the store's shoppers that made their visit 
    because they had received a coupon in the mail is NOT 25%?
  CorrectAnswer: No, 0.25 is in the interval.
  AnswerChoices: No, 0.25 is in the interval.; Yes, 0.25 is in the interval.; Unknown, we cannot use this
    confidence interval to test at this level of significance.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No, 0.25 is in the interval.')
  Hint: What happens to our interval if we increase our significance level? How do we interpret a 
    confidence interval?
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your confidence interval, is there sufficient evidence at the 0.10 level of significance 
    to reject H0 and conclude that the true proportion of the store's shoppers that made their visit 
    because they had received a coupon in the mail is NOT 25%?
  CorrectAnswer: Unknown, we cannot use this confidence interval to test at this level of significance.
  AnswerChoices: No, 0.25 is in the interval.; Yes, 0.25 is in the interval.; Unknown, we cannot use this
    confidence interval to test at this level of significance.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Unknown, we cannot use this confidence interval to test at this level of significance.')
  Hint: What happens to our interval if we increase our significance level? How do we interpret a 
    confidence interval?
    
- Class: text
  Output: Note that at the 99% confidence level, our interval will widen. Therefore, if 0.25 is in our 95% 
    confidence interval, it will also be in our 99% confidence interval. 

- Class: text
  Output: Note also that at the 90% confidence level, our interval will narrow. We would need to calculate 
    the confidence interval at the 0.1 level of significance in order to know for sure whether 0.25 
    appears in the interval.
