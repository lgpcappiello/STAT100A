  Output: Today's lab is on the normal distribution. We will practice calculating Z-scores and
    normal probabilities. We will also demonstrate how we can use R to find tail area using a 
    Z-score and to find Z-scores using a percentile.

- Class: text
  Output: Although the lab requirements are limited to what you do in the R console, I recommend
    pulling out a piece of paper and drawing out your normal curves for each problem! This will
    help cement some of these ideas and is a good way to keep track of tail area problems. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we have a normal distribution with mean mu=19 and standard deviation sigma=3, 
    N(19, 3). We can find the Z-score using our formula, (x - mu)/(sigma).
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's find the Z-score for x=12 from N(19,3). Type (12 - 19)/3 and press Enter. 
  CorrectAnswer: (12 - 19)/3 = -2.33
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = (12 - 19)/3)
  Hint: R is a big calculator! Type (12 - 19)/3 and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now let's calculate the left-tail area, or P(X < 12) where X is from a N(19,3) 
    distribution. We've already calculated the Z-score as -2.33. Type pnorm(-2.33) and press 
    Enter to find this tail area.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(-2.33)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'pnorm(-2.33)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(-2.33) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also use R to find Z-scores when given a percentile. Suppose we wanted to know
    the 80th percentile for our N(19,3) distribution. Type qnorm(0.80) and press Enter. 
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.80)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'qnorm(0.80)')
  Hint: Type qnorm(0.80) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we can use this Z-score (z = 0.84) to find the corresponding value at the 80th 
    percentile of our N(19,3) distribution. Solving for x, x = z*sigma + mu. Type 0.84*3 + 19 
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.84*3 + 19
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.84*3 + 19')
  Hint: Type 0.84*3 + 19 and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great! Those are the core concepts that you will need to be able to complete the 
    rest of this lab.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Let's use R to demonstrate the 68-95-99.7 Rule. We expect 68% of the area to fall within 
    1 standard deviation of the mean. Since this corresponds to Z-scores of -1 and 1, we can use 
    our Z-scores to demonstrate this! We want the area between -1 and 1 on a standard normal distribution,
    N(0,1). This would be a good time to sketch a picture!
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To find the left tail area, or P(Z < -1), type pnorm(-1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(-1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'pnorm(-1)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(-1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To find the right tail area, or P(Z > 1), type 1-pnorm(1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 1-pnorm(1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '1-pnorm(1)')
  Hint: Type 1-pnorm(1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, let's put that all together to find the area under the curve between -1 and 1,
    or P(-1 < Z < 1). We use [(area under entire curve) - (right tail area) - (left tail area)] or 
    [1 - (1-pnorm(1)) - pnorm(-1)]. This simplifies to pnorm(1)-pnorm(-1). Type either 
    pnorm(1)-pnorm(-1) OR 1 - (1-pnorm(1)) - pnorm(-1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(1)-pnorm(-1)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('pnorm(1)-pnorm(-1)', '1 - (1-pnorm(1)) - pnorm(-1)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(1)-pnorm(-1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This is the 68% part of the 68-95-99.7 rule! Let's try it for the area within 2 standard
    deviations. Revise your picture to include z=-2 and z=2. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's put this into R using the same approach as before, but now we are going to use our
    picture to help us skip a couple of steps. We want [1 - (1-pnorm(2)) - pnorm(-2)], which will
    simplify to pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2). Type either pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2) OR 1 - (1-pnorm(2)) - pnorm(-2)
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2)', '1 - (1-pnorm(2)) - pnorm(-2)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Last one! Let's examine the area within 3 standard deviations. Update your picture and
    use the R code from the previous questions as a guide to find this area.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(3)-pnorm(-3)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('pnorm(3)-pnorm(-3)', '1 - (1-pnorm(3)) - pnorm(-3)')
  Hint: Use the R code from the previous question as a guide to find the area under the curve 
    between z=-3 and z=3.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What percent of a standard normal distribution N(mu = 0,sigma = 1) is found in the region
    Z < -1.35? This is the same as asking for P(Z < -1.35). Be sure to draw a graph. Recall that pnorm(z)
    gives the left tail area for a Z-score. 
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(-1.35)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'pnorm(-1.35)')
  Hint: Type pnorm(z), replacing z with the appropriate Z-score, and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What percent of a standard normal distribution N(mu = 0,sigma = 1) is found in the region
    Z > 1.48? This is the same as asking for P(Z > 1.48). Be sure to draw a graph. Recall that pnorm(z)
    gives the left tail area for a Z-score. 
  CorrectAnswer: 1-pnorm(1.48)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '1-pnorm(1.48)')
  Hint: We want the right tail area, so we need to take 1-(left area)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What percent of a standard normal distribution N(mu = 0,sigma = 1) is found in the region
    -0.4 < Z < 1.5? This is the same as asking for P(-0.4 < Z < 1.5). Be sure to draw a graph.
    Recall that pnorm(z) gives the left tail area for a Z-score. 
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(1.5)-pnorm(-0.4)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('pnorm(1.5)-pnorm(-0.4)', '1-(1-pnorm(1.5))-pnorm(-0.4)')
  Hint: Check your graph! Remember what we did for our 68-95-99.7 problem.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What percent of a standard normal distribution N(mu = 0,sigma = 1) is found in the region
    |Z| < 2? This is the same as asking for P(|Z| < 2). Be sure to draw a graph. Recall that pnorm(z) 
    gives the left tail area for a Z-score. 
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('pnorm(2)-pnorm(-2)', '1-(1-pnorm(2))-pnorm(-2)')
  Hint: P(|Z| < 2) is the same as P(-2 < Z < 2).

  Output: The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77 degrees F with a standard deviation 
    of 5 degrees F. It can be assumed that they to follow a normal distribution. We use the following 
    equation to convert degrees F (Fahrenheit) to degrees C (Celsius), C = (F − 32) × (5/9).
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the mean of the distribution of temperature in degrees Celcius?
  CorrectAnswer: (77-32)*(5/9) = 25
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=25)
  Hint: Notice that the Fahrenheit to Celcius equation looks a lot like the Z-score equation! Use it to
    rescale the distribution from Celcius to Fahrenheit.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the standard deviation of temperature in degrees Celcius? Round your answer to 2 decimal
    places.
  CorrectAnswer: 5*(5/9) = 2.78
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=2.78)
  Hint: Notice that moving the normal distribution right or left (by changing the mean) does not change
    the standard deviation. Therefore you can ignore the directional shift (subtracting 32) when 
    finding the new standard deviation. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: Now we want to find the probability of observing a 28 degrees C temperature or higher in June 
    in LA.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, find the appropriate Z-score for a temperature or 28 degrees C. Round your answer to 
    two decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: (28-25)/2.78 = 1.08
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1.08)
  Hint: z = (x - mu)/sigma
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now use this z-score to calculate the probability of observing a 28 degrees C 
    temperature or higher in June in LA. Enter your solution in terms of the pnorm(z) command.
    Recall that pnorm(z) gives the left-tail area for z. 
  CorrectAnswer: 1-pnorm(1.08)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '1-pnorm(1.08)')
  Hint: We want the right-tail area for z=1.08. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, we want to estimate the IQR of the temperatures (in degrees C) in June in LA.
    Recall that IQR = Q3 - Q1, the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, let's find the z-score for Q3. Enter your solution in terms of the R command 
    qnorm(p). Recall that qnorm(p) will give the Z-score for a percentile p. 
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.75)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'qnorm(0.75)')
  Hint: We want to find the the 75th percentile using qnorm(p). The 75th percentile is the point
    at which 75% of the data is lower than that value.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to find the temperate (in degrees C) that corresponds to this Z-score. Use
    the Z-score formula to find this value. Report your answer rounded to two decimal places.
    Recall that our distribution is a N(25, 2.78).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.75)*2.78 + 25 = 26.88
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('qnorm(0.75)*2.78 + 25', '26.86', '26.87', '26.88')
  Hint: Plug your Z-score from the previous question into the Z-score formula and solve for x.
    Round your answer to two decimal places. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next, let's find the z-score for Q1. Enter your solution in terms of the R command 
    qnorm(p). Recall that qnorm(p) will give the Z-score for a percentile p. 
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.25)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'qnorm(0.25)')
  Hint: We want to find the the 25th percentile using qnorm(p). The 25th percentile is the point
    at which 25% of the data is lower than that value.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to find the temperate (in degrees C) that corresponds to this Z-score. Use
    the Z-score formula to find this value. Report your answer rounded to two decimal places.
    Recall that our distribution is a N(25, 2.78).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.25)*2.78 + 25 = 23.12
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('qnorm(0.25)*2.78 + 25', '23.12', '23.13', '23.14')
  Hint: Plug your Z-score from the previous question into the Z-score formula and solve for x.
    Round your answer to two decimal places.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally we can use these values to find the IQR. To remove any rounding error, Q1 = 23.13 
    and Q3 = 26.86. Find the IQR using these values.
  CorrectAnswer: Q3 - Q1 = 26.86 - 23.13 = 3.73
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 3.73)
  Hint: IQR = Q3 - Q1
