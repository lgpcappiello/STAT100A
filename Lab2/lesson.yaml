- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's spend some time thinking about populations and samples. The Tooth Growth dataset
    examines the relationship between different vitamin C supplements and tooth growth in guinea pigs. 
    Start by loading the data: type data(ToothGrowth) and then press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: data(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type data(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Guinea pigs were given vitamin C in two forms: either orange juice or ascorbic acid. 
    Suppose we want to know which supplement type is better for increasing tooth growth rates in 
    guinea pigs. What is the population in this study?
  CorrectAnswer: all guinea pigs
  AnswerChoices: all guinea pigs; all guinea pig teeth\; all vitamin c supplements
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='all guinea pigs')
  Hint: Who or what is being sampled? (Recall that our sample recieves the treatment.)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the explanatory variable?
  CorrectAnswer: supplement type
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='supplement type')
  Hint: Which variable do we think explains one of the others?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the response variable?
  CorrectAnswer: tooth length
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='tooth length')
  Hint: Which variable do we think changes in response to something?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's make the tooth growth data R's top priority. Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: attach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do you think supplement type impacts tooth growth? We can use a boxplot to visualize this 
    relationship. Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len~supp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len~supp)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The boxplot shows two boxes, one for orange juice (OJ) and one for ascorbic acid (VC).
    The y-axis shows length of odontoblasts, the cells responsible for guinea pigs' tooth growth.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which supplement has a longer median cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: orange juice (OJ)
  AnswerChoices: orange juice (OJ); ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='orange juice')
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which supplement has a greater spread in cell lengths?
  CorrectAnswer: ascorbic acid
  AnswerChoices: orange juice; ascorbic acid
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ascorbic acid') 
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the approximate interquartile range for the cell lengths for guinea pigs who
    recieved orange juice?
  CorrectAnswer: 26-15=11
  AnswerChoices: 26-15=11; 31-8=23; 34-4=30; 23-11=12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='26-15=11')
  Hint: Double check your numbers!
   
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Are there any outliers?
  CorrectAnswer: no
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='no')
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now let's suppose that the guinea pigs recieved different doses of vitamin c supplements.
    We are interested in whether dosage has an effect on how supplement type impacts the guinea 
    pigs' tooth growth. How might we include dosages?
  CorrectAnswer: add dose as a blocking factor
  AnswerChoices: add dose as a blocking factor; do a bloxplot of the different doses; don't bother
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='add dose as a blocking factor')
  Hint: Think back to what we talked about in class...
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also visualize blocked data with boxplots! Think of each combination of treatment 
    (supplement type) and block (dosage) as one "treatment". For example, OJ at 0.5 mg is one 
    treatment setting and OJ at 1 mg is another treatment setting. Type boxplot(len~supp*dose)
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len~supp*dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len~supp*dose)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp*dose) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Ouput: There are two treatments (OJ and VC) and three blocks (0.5, 1, and 2 mg doses), so there are
    2*3=6 total treatment settings. There are also 6 boxplots, one for each! 
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has the lowest median tooth growth cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 0.5 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 0.5 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has the lowest median?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has a potential outlier?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 1 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 1 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has a potential outlier?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Earlier, we used the "attach" command to make the tooth growth data R's top priority, but now 
    we're done looking at this data set. Let's free up R's memory for something else. Type 
    detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: detach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='detach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
