  Output: We will start today's lab thinking about associations between two numeric variables. 
    
- Class: figure
  Output: The next few questions will involve these scatterplots (don't close out of them!). 
  Figure: associations.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a positive association?
  CorrectAnswer: A and B
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A and B')
  Hint: In a positive association, as one variable increases, the other variable also increases.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a negative association?
  CorrectAnswer: D
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='D')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show a linear association?
  CorrectAnswer: A and D
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A and D')
  Hint: A linear association is when the points fall around a (straight) line.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the plots show no association?
  CorrectAnswer: C
  AnswerChoices: A and B; A; B; D; A and D; C
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='C')
  Hint: If there is no association, you won't be able to draw a line/curve through the points.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: Histograms show the distribution of data. This is an important consideration and something
    we think about a lot in statistics! For example, consider these four histograms.
  Figure: hists.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do these histograms have in common?
  CorrectAnswer: approximately the same means
  AnswerChoices: nothing; approximately the same means; approximately the same standard deviations; 
    approximately the same means and standard deviations
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='approximately the same means')
  Hint: Look carefully at the histograms.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Right! They all come from populations with the same means (10). If we only looked at the 
    averages, we would have no idea that we have four very different sets of data on our hands. 
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's focus our attention on Histogram A. Do you expect the mean to be higher, lower, or 
    about the same as the median?
  CorrectAnswer: about the same
  AnswerChoices: higher; lower; about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='about the same')
  Hint: How do you think the middle of the data compares to the mean?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the details. First, let's see what the mean of our sample is. Remember that 
    our population mean is 10. Type mean(v1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(v1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(v1)')
  Hint: Type mean(v1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now let's check the median. Type median(v1) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: median(v1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(v1)')
  Hint: Type median(v1) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Both the mean and the median are close to 10, but notice that neither one is exactly 10.
    This is because v1 is a random sample of the population. We can get a good estimate of the true
    population mean, but we won't get the exact value. 
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now focus on on Histogram D. Do you expect the mean to be higher, lower, or about the 
    same as the median?
  CorrectAnswer: higher
  AnswerChoices: higher; lower; about the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='higher')
  Hint: How do you think the middle of the data compares to the mean?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's check the details. Let's see what the mean of our sample is. Remember that our 
    population mean is still 10. Type mean(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(v4)')
  Hint: Type mean(v4) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, now let's check the median. Type median(v4) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: median(v4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='median(v4)')
  Hint: Type median(v4) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Because our data has some outliers, the sample mean is quite a bit larger than the median. 
    Sometimes, when we have outliers, the median gives us a better idea of the "middle" of the data 
    than does the mean.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of these variables would be best represented by the median instead of the mean (choose 
    the best answer)?
  CorrectAnswer: California household income
  AnswerChoices: California household income; height of UCR college students; duration of domestic flights
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='California household income')
  Hint: Which variable is most likely to have extreme outliers?
  
- Class: text
  Output: Right. There are likely to be some outliers in height and flight duration, but household income
    is likely to have the most extreme outliers. I certainly don't want my income compared to whatever Kim
    Kardashian pulls in each year. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's spend some time thinking about populations and samples. The Tooth Growth dataset
    examines the relationship between different vitamin C supplements and tooth growth in guinea pigs. 
    Start by loading the data. Type data(ToothGrowth) and then press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: data(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type data(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Guinea pigs were given vitamin C in two forms, either orange juice or ascorbic acid. 
    Suppose we want to know which supplement type is better for increasing tooth growth rates in 
    guinea pigs. What is the population in this study?
  CorrectAnswer: all guinea pigs
  AnswerChoices: all guinea pigs; all guinea pig teeth; all vitamin c supplements
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='all guinea pigs')
  Hint: Who or what is being sampled? (Recall that our sample recieves the treatment.)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the explanatory variable?
  CorrectAnswer: supplement type
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='supplement type')
  Hint: Which variable do we think explains one of the others?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the response variable?
  CorrectAnswer: tooth length
  AnswerChoices: supplement type; guinea pigs; tooth length
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='tooth length')
  Hint: Which variable do we think changes in response to something?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's make the tooth growth data R's top priority. Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: attach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type attach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Do you think supplement type impacts tooth growth? We can use a boxplot to visualize this 
    relationship. Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len~supp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len~supp)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The boxplot shows two boxes, one for orange juice (OJ) and one for ascorbic acid (VC).
    The y-axis shows length of odontoblasts, the cells responsible for guinea pigs' tooth growth.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which supplement has a longer median cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: orange juice (OJ)
  AnswerChoices: orange juice (OJ); ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='orange juice (OJ)')
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which supplement has a greater spread in cell lengths?
  CorrectAnswer: ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerChoices: orange juice (OJ); ascorbic acid (VC)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ascorbic acid (VC)') 
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the approximate interquartile range for the cell lengths for guinea pigs who
    recieved orange juice?
  CorrectAnswer: 26-15=11
  AnswerChoices: 26-15=11; 31-8=23; 34-4=30; 23-11=12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='26-15=11')
  Hint: Double check your numbers!
   
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Are there any outliers?
  CorrectAnswer: no
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='no')
  Hint: Try again!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now let's suppose that the guinea pigs recieved different doses of vitamin c supplements.
    We are interested in whether dosage has an effect on how supplement type impacts the guinea 
    pigs' tooth growth. How might we include dosages?
  CorrectAnswer: add dose as a blocking factor
  AnswerChoices: add dose as a blocking factor; do a bloxplot of the different doses; don't bother
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='add dose as a blocking factor')
  Hint: Think back to what we talked about in class...
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We can also visualize blocked data with boxplots! Think of each combination of treatment 
    (supplement type) and block (dosage) as one "treatment". For example, OJ at 0.5 mg is one 
    treatment setting and OJ at 1 mg is another treatment setting. Type boxplot(len~supp*dose)
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(len~supp*dose)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(len~supp*dose)')
  Hint: Type boxplot(len~supp*dose) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are two treatments (OJ and VC) and three blocks (0.5, 1, and 2 mg doses), so there are
    2*3=6 total treatment settings. There are also 6 boxplots, one for each! 
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has the lowest median tooth growth cell length?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 0.5 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 0.5 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has the lowest median?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which treatment/block combination has a potential outlier?
  CorrectAnswer: VC with 1 mg
  AnswerChoices: VC with 0.5 mg; VC with 1 mg; VC with 2 mg; OJ with 0.5 mg; OJ with 1 mg; OJ with 2 mg
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='VC with 1 mg')
  Hint: The axis labels show each treatment setting as TREATMENT.DOSE. Which one has a potential outlier?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Earlier, we used the "attach" command to make the tooth growth data R's top priority, but now 
    we're done looking at this data set. Let's free up R's memory for something else. Type 
    detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: detach(ToothGrowth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='detach(ToothGrowth)')
  Hint: Type detach(ToothGrowth) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great! In this case, we are not going to work with any other datasets, but removing attached 
    data from R's memory is a good habit to get into when we finish working with something.
