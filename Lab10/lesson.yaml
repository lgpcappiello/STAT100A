  Output: For your final lab (!!) we are going to go over one sample t-tests and regression concepts.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We will again work between Swirl (R) and a Google form. Minimize R and navigate to the course
    website. Click the link under Lab 10. In order to complete the lab, move between R and the web 
    browser as necessary. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 22 police 
    officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement 
    in a primarily urban environment. The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration
    of 124.32 micrograms/liter and a SD of 37.74 micrograms/liter.
    
- Class: text
  Output: A previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an 
    average blood level concentration of 35 micrograms/liter. We want to know whether police officers
    have blood lead levels different from average.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Switch to the Google form now and answer the questions about the hypotheses and conditions
    for this problem.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now we want to test your hypotheses. We will test at a significance level of 0.05. What is 
    the null value (mu0)?
  CorrectAnswer: 35
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=35)
  Hint: The null value is the assumed value in our null hypothesis.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the mean (x bar)?
  CorrectAnswer: 124.32
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=124.32)
  Hint: What is the mean lead level for the police officers?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the standard deviation (s)?
  CorrectAnswer: 37.74
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=37.74)
  Hint: What is the standard deviation of lead levels for the police officers?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What are the degrees of freedom?
  CorrectAnswer: 21
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=21)
  Hint: Degrees of freedom = n-1
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's put some of this information together. Find the test statistic for this problem. If necessary, round
    your answer to four decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 11.1009
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=11.1009)
  Hint: The formula for this test statistic is available on the course website in the slides and on the 
    practice final.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's find the critical value for this setting. For the t distibution, we will use the R function
    qt(alpha/2, df) to find the (negative version of the) critical value. Try that now. Type qt(alpha/2, df)
    replacing alpha by the significance level and df by the degrees of freedom calculated previously.
  CorrectAnswer: qt(0.05/2, 21)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qt(0.05/2, 21)')
  Hint: Use qt(alpha/2, df) with the correct values for alpha and df.
  
- Class: text
  Output: It is now possible to complete this test using the test statistic approach! However, we would also
    like to try out the p-value approach.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's find the p-value for this test. For the left-tail area of the t-distriution, we use the R
    command pt(-t, df) where t = |test statistic| and df is the degrees of freedom. Use the command
    2*pt(-t, df), replacing t with |test statistic| and df with the degrees of freedom, to find the
    p-value.
  CorrectAnswer: 2*pt(-11.1009, 21)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2*pt(-11.1009, 21)')
  Hint: Use 2*pt(-t, df) with the correct values for t and df.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Minimize R and return to the Google form to finish Part I.

- Class: text
  Output: We will now turn our attention to regression.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We will use one of R's built in datasets to think about regression. Type data("trees") and press
    Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: data("trees")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data("trees")')
  Hint: Type data("trees") and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, let's see what's in this data. Type help(trees) to get the R documentation file for this
    data. 
  CorrectAnswer: help(trees)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='help(trees)')
  Hint: Type help(trees) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Earlier this term, we used the attach command in R to make data easier to access. Let's do this 
    now. Type attach(trees) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: attach(trees)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='attach(trees)')
  Hint: Type attach(trees) and press Enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see if the height of a tree is a good way to predict its girth. That is, we want to see if
    height and girth are linearly correlated. To examine the linear correlation, we can start with a basic
    scatterplot. Type plot(Girth ~ Height) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: plot(Girth ~ Height)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(Girth ~ Height)')
  Hint: Type plot(Girth ~ Height) and press Enter. Recall that R is case sensitive!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's find the actual correlation coefficient. Calculating this by hand for 31 observations
    would be extremely cumbersome! Luckily, R has a command for this. Type cor(Girth, Height) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: cor(Girth, Height)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cor(Girth, Height)')
  Hint: Type cor(Girth, Height) and press Enter.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we want to build a regression model. Type lm(Girth ~ Height) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: lm(Girth ~ Height)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='lm(Girth ~ Height)')
  Hint: Type lm(Girth ~ Height) and press Enter. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: This prints the intercept and slope for the regression line. That is, y(hat) = intercept + slope*x.
    It may be helpful to write this equation down now, using the values R printed for your regression model.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the regression line to predict the girth of a black cherry tree that is 77 feet tall.
  CorrectAnswer: 13.5005
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=13.5005)
  Hint: Use the regression line with height = 77 to predict the girth of a 77 foot tall tree.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the regression line to predict the girth of a black cherry tree that is 150 feet tall.
  CorrectAnswer: 32.1666
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=32.1666)
  Hint: Use the regression line with height = 150 to predict the girth of a 77 foot tall tree.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Return to the Google form and make sure it is completely filled out before continuing with the lab
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, let's take a minute to look at the significance of our parameters. Type summary(lm(Girth ~ Height))
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm(Girth ~ Height))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(lm(Girth ~ Height))')
  Hint: Type summary(lm(Girth ~ Height)) and press Enter.
 
- Class: text
  Output: For each parameter, the null hypothesis is Beta = 0. If a parameter is nonsignificant, we assume either the
    intercept is zero or the variables are not related. The test statistics are in the column labeled t value and the 
     p-values are in the column labeled Pr(>|t|). The summary will also show the parameter estimate and its standard error.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the p-value for the intercept?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.30772
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.30772)
  Hint: Find the p-value for the intercept.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Testing at a 0.05 level of significance, the p-value > alpha. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
    This means that we are unable to conclude that our intercept is nonzero.
    
- Class: text
  Output: This makes sense! If we have a tree that is 0 feet tall, we'd expect the girth also to be 0.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the p-value for the slope (height)?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.00276
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.00276)
  Hint: Find the p-value for the slope.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Testing at a 0.05 level of significance, the p-value < alpha. Therefore we reject the null hypothesis and conclude
    that the slope is nonzero. This means that there is a significant relationship between height and girth for these trees.

- Class: text
  Output: In order to recieve credit for Lab 10 (8/28/19), raise your hand and ask your TA to confirm 
    that you have reached the end of the Swirl lesson. This will count as your lab grade and 
     attendance for the day.
