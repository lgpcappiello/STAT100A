  Output: In this lab, we will go over the Poisson distribution and will focus on point estimates 
    and sampling variability. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: For Monday through Thursday when there isn’t a holiday, the average number of vehicles that 
    visit a particular retailer between 2pm and 3pm each afternoon is 6.5, and the number of cars that 
    show up on any given day follows a Poisson distribution.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that exactly 5 cars will show up next Monday? Round your answer to
    three decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: P(X=5) = 0.145
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.145)
  Hint: Find P(X=5) for a Poisson distribution with mean 6.5
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that 0, 1, or 2 cars will show up next Monday between 2pm and 3pm? 
    Round your answer to three decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0430
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('0.043','0.044')
  Hint: Find P(X <= 2).
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We want to know if it would be unusal to see an observation of 10 cars. Calculate the Z-score 
    for this observation. Round your Z-score to three decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: (10-6.5)/sqrt(6.5) = 1.373
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=1.373)
  Hint: Find the Z-score for X=10 cars. Use the Poisson distribution to find the appropriate
    mean and standard deviation.
    
- Class: text
  Output: 10 cars is 1.37 standard deviations above the mean, so it is not considered to be an unusual
    observation. We would not be surprised to see an observation of 10 vehicles.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To find P(X=x) for a Poisson distribution with parameter lambda, we can also use the R 
    command dpois(x, lambda). Suppose we have a Poisson distribution with lambda = 7. Let's find
    the probability that X=6. Type dpois(x=6, lambda=7) and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: dpois(x=6, lambda=7)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dpois(x=6, lambda=7)')
  Hint: Type dpois(x=6, lambda=7) and press Enter.  
    
- Class: text
  Output: For each of the following questions, determine whether the parameter of interest is a 
    proportion or a mean.

  Output: A poll shows that 64% of Americans personally worry a great deal about federal spending and 
    the budget deficit.
  CorrectAnswer: proportion
  AnswerChoices: mean; proportion; neither
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='proportion')
  Hint: Are we interested in a mean or a proportion?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: A survey reports that local TV news has shown a 17% increase in revenue within a two year 
    period while newspaper revenues decreased by 6.4% during this time period.
  CorrectAnswer: mean
  AnswerChoices: mean; proportion; neither
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='mean')
  Hint: Are we interested in a mean or a proportion?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: In a survey, high school and college students are asked whether or not they use geolocation 
    services on their smart phones.
  CorrectAnswer: proportion
  AnswerChoices: mean; proportion; neither
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='proportion')
  Hint: Are we interested in a mean or a proportion?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: In a survey, smart phone users are asked how many times they used a web-based taxi 
    service over the last year.
  CorrectAnswer: mean
  AnswerChoices: mean; proportion; neither
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='mean')
  Hint: Are we interested in a mean or a proportion?
  
- Class: text
  Output: In a random sample 765 adults in the United States, 322 say they could not cover a $400 
    unexpected expense without borrowing money or going into debt. Use this information to answer
    the next few questions.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the point estimate for the parameter of interest? Enter your answer as a whole number
    or a formula, e.g., (2+2)/3
  CorrectAnswer: 322/765 = 0.42
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=322/765)
  Hint: Are we interested in a mean or a proportion? How do we calculate each?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the estimated standard error for this point estimate? Round your answer to three 
    decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(((322/765)*(1 - 322/765))/765) = 0.0178
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.018)
  Hint: How do we calculate standard error for an estimate?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose the true population value was found to be 40%. Use this proportion to recompute 
    the standard error. Round your answer to three decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt((0.4*(1 - 0.4))/765) = 0.0177
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.018)
  Hint: How do we calculate standard error for an estimate?

- Class: text
  Output: Right! Notice that, even though the estimate was slightly different from the truth, 
    the standard error is the same when rounded to three decimal places! 
    
- Class: text
  Output: Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean’s list in the current year. 
    As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students 
    made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is this distribution called?
  CorrectAnswer: sampling distribution
  AnswerChoices: sampling distribution; Poisson distribution; binomial distribution; proportion distribution
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='sampling distribution')
  Hint: Remember what we went over in lecture today.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?
  CorrectAnswer: right skewed
  AnswerChoices: symmetric; right skewed; left skewed
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='right skewed')
  Hint: Is the Central Limit Theorem satisfied? What happens when we have too few expected successes?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Calculate the variability of this distribution. Round your answer to three decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt((0.16*(1 - 0.16))/40) = 0.0580
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.058)
  Hint: How do we calculate standard error for an estimate?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, 
    and they again collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How 
    will the variability of this new distribution compare to the value you just calculated?
  CorrectAnswer: it will decrease
  AnswerChoices: it will increase; it will decrease; it will not change
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='it will decrease')
  Hint: How does sample size impact standard error?

  Output: You have successfully completed Lab 7! Way to go!

- Class: text
  Output: In order to recieve credit for Lab 7 (8/19/19), raise your hand and ask your TA to confirm 
    that you have reached the end of the Swirl lesson. This will count as your lab grade and 
     attendance for the day.
