- Class: text
  Output: This lab will focus on hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for a single proportion.
  
- Class: text
  Output: 400 students were randomly sampled from a large university, and 289 said they did not get 
    enough sleep. Conduct a hypothesis test to check whether this represents a statistically significant 
    difference from 50%, and use a significance level of 0.01.
    
- Class: text
  Output: We will begin by using a confidence interval to examine this claim and then will conduct a
    hypothesis test using both the test statistic and p-value approaches.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is p hat, our point estimate?
  CorrectAnswer: 289/400 = 0.7225
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=289/400)
  Hint: Use the problem statement to help calculate the point estimate.
  
- Class: text
  Output: For our confidence interval, we also need the standard error and critical value.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use qnorm(alpha/2) to find -z(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.01/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.01/2)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2), replacing alpha with the correct significance level. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now find the standard error for p. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0224
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.0224)
  Hint: Use the formula for the standard error in a confidence interval for p. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the margin of error for your confidence interval? Round to 4 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 0.0577
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.0577)
  Hint: Margin of error = (critical value) x (SE)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the upper limit of the confidence interval?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.7225 + 0.0577 = 0.7802
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.7802)
  Hint: Point estimate +- Margin of Error
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the lower limit of the confidence interval?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.7225 - 0.0577 = 0.6648
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.6648)
  Hint: Point estimate +- Margin of Error 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the confidence interval, do significantly more or less than 50% of students get 
    enough sleep? (Is there sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis?)
  CorrectAnswer: Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.
  AnswerChoices: Yes, because the null proportion is in the interval.; No, because the null proportion is 
    in the interval.; Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.; No, because the null 
    proportion is not in the interval.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes, because the null proportion is not in the interval.')
  Hint: Based on the confidence interval, what is your conclusion?
  
- Class: text
  Output: To interpret any general confidence interval, we say the following.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Based on the interval, one can be (1-alpha)100% confident that the true proportion of whatever
    we are interested in is between lower limit and upper limit.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Just don't forget to fill in all of the details based on the problem statement!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's look at our problem statement again. 400 students were randomly sampled from a large 
    university, and 289 said they did not get enough sleep. Conduct a hypothesis test to check whether 
    this represents a statistically significant difference from 50%, and use a significance level of 0.01.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We found p hat already. Enter its value again now so that it's easy to find. 
  CorrectAnswer: 289/400 = 0.7225
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=289/400)
  Hint: Use the problem statement to help calculate the point estimate.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We also found the (negative of the) critical value already, but let's find that in again using 
    qnorm(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.01/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.01/2)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2), replacing alpha with the correct significance level. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We calculated the standard error for our confidence interval, but it will be slightly different 
    for our test statistic. Find that value now. 
  CorrectAnswer: 0.025
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.025)
  Hint: Use the standard error formula for the test statistic approach.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use this value to find the test statisic.
  CorrectAnswer: 8.9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=8.9)
  Hint: Use the formula for the test statisic for single proportions.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the test statisic and critical value, what can we conclude?
  CorrectAnswer: The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null 
    hypothesis.
  AnswerChoices: The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null 
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, so we reject the null 
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null 
    hypothesis.; The test statistic is less extreme than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null 
    hypothesis.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, so we 
    reject the null hypothesis.')
  Hint: Remember to take the absolute values.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we want to find the p-value for this problem. Recall that the p-value is 2 x P(Z < -|z|) 
    where z is the test statistic. Find this value using 2*pnorm(-|z|).
  CorrectAnswer: 2*pnorm(-8.9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2*pnorm(-8.9)')
  Hint: Make sure to replace |z| by the absolute value of your test statisic.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the level of significance and p-value, what can we conclude?
  CorrectAnswer: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis. 
  AnswerChoices: The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater 
    than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.; The p-value is less than alpha, so we fail to reject 
    the null hypothesis.; The p-value is greater than alpha, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The p-value is less than alpha, so we reject the null hypothesis.')
  Hint: How do we use a p-value to draw conclusions in a hypothesis test?
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on our hypothesis testing, how would we finalize our conclusion?
  CorrectAnswer: There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of 
    significance to conclude that more than 50% of students do not get enough sleep.
  AnswerChoices: There is insufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that more 
    than 50% of students do not get enough sleep.; There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of 
    significance to conclude that more than 50% of students do not get enough sleep.; There is sufficient 
    evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that 50% of students do not get enough sleep.; 
    There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to conclude that 72.25% of students 
    do not get enough sleep. 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 level of significance to 
    conclude that more than 50% of students do not get enough sleep.')
  Hint: How do we interpret our conclusion from the previous problem?
  
- Class: text
  Output: The General Social Survey asked 1,578 US residents, “Do you think the use of marijuana should 
    be made legal, or not?” 61% of the respondents said it should be made legal. We want to test whether, 
    on average, US residents approve or disapprove of legal marijuana use at the 0.05 level of significance.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the point estimate?
  CorrectAnswer: 0.61
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.61)
  Hint: Make sure your answer is written as a proportion and not a percent.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the (negative of the) critical value? Use qnorm(alpha/2).
  CorrectAnswer: qnorm(0.05/2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='qnorm(0.05/2)')
  Hint: Use qnorm(alpha/2) with alpha from the problem statement.

  Output: What is the test statistic? Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: 8.7393
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=8.7393)
  Hint: Use the formula for the test statistic for test of one proportion.
