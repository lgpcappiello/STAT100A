- Class: text
  Output: For today's lab, we are going to work on concepts related to the binomial distribution.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's start by thinking about "n choose k". How many ways can you arrange 3 successes (and
    5 failures) in 8 trials?
  CorrectAnswer: 8 choose 3 = 8!/[3!(5-3)!] = 56
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=56)
  Hint: Find 8 choose 3.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How many ways can you arrange n successes (and 0 failures) in n trials?
  CorrectAnswer: n choose n = n!/[n!(n-n)!] = 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=1)
  Hint: Carefully write out the formula for n choose n.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How many ways can you arrange 1 successes (and n-1 failures) in n trials?
  CorrectAnswer: n choose 1 = n!/(1!*(n-1)!) = n
  AnswerChoices: n; n-1; 1; n/2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='n')
  Hint: Carefully write out the formula for n choose 1.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that we've thought about n choose k, we want to work with the binomial distribution.
  
- Class: text 
  Output: Your textbook claims that about 70% of 18-20 year olds consume alcoholic beverages in 
    any given year. Consider a random sample of fifty 18-20 year olds.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: How many people from your sample would you expect to have consumed alcoholic beverages in
    the previous year? 
  CorrectAnswer: 50*0.7=35
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=35)
  Hint: What is the expected value for a binomial distribution?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Estimate the expected standard deviation for this sample. Round your answer to two decimal 
    places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(np(1-p)) = sqrt(50*0.7*0.3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=3.24)
  Hint: What is the formula for the standard deviation of a binomial distribution?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the probability that between (and including) 34 and 36 people in this sample 
    have consumed alcoholic beverages in the past year? Note that this is P(34 <= X <= 36). Round
    your answer to two decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: P(X = 34) + P(X = 35) + P(X = 36) = 0.1147 + 0.1223 + 0.1189 = 0.3559 -> 0.36
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('0.36','.36','0.35','.35')
  Hint: P(34 <= X <= 36) = P(X = 34) + P(X = 35) + P(X = 36)
  
- Class: text
  Output: Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder where red blood cells lose their 
    flexibility and assume an abnormal, rigid, “sickle” shape, which results in a risk of various 
    complications. If both parents are carriers of the disease, then a child has a 25% chance of 
    having the disease (X), 50% chance of being a carrier (Y), and 25% chance of neither having the 
    disease nor being a carrier (Z). 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the probability that 
    two of those children will have the disease? Round your answer to two decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: P(X = 2) = (3 choose 2) * (0.25)^2 * (1-0.25)^1 = 0.14
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.14)
  Hint: There are n=3 children and each has a 25% chance of having the disease.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the probability that 
    none of those children will have the disease? Round your answer to two decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: P(X = 0) = (3 choose 0) * (0.25)^0 * (1-0.25)^3 = 0.42
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.42)
  Hint: There are n=3 children and each has a 25% chance of having the disease.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the probability that 
    at least one of those children will be a carrier? Do not round your answer.
  CorrectAnswer: P(Y >= 1) = P(Y > 0) = 1 - P(Y = 0) = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=0.875)
  Hint: There are n=3 children and each has a 50% chance of neither having the disease nor being a 
    carrier.
  
- Class: text
  Output: For Lab 5, we used an R command pnorm to find the left tail area for a normal distribution.
    For the binomial distribution, we have a command that will tell us the probability that we see
    exactly k successes. This is the dbinom() command.
    
- Class: text
  Output: We need to tell the dbinom() command our values for k, n, and p. Recall that k is the 
    number of successes we are interested in, n is the total number of trials, and p is the 
    probability of a success.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try this out. If we flip a fair coin 10 times and want to know the probability of getting
    exactly 3 heads, then n=10, k=3, and p=0.5. To find this probability, type dbinom(3, size=10, prob=0.5) 
    and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: dbinom(3, size=10, prob=0.5)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('dbinom(3, size=10, prob=0.5)','dbinom(3, 10, 0.5)')
  Hint: Type dbinom(3, size=10, prob=0.5) and press Enter.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great! We are not going to focus on this R command because the binomial distribution is 
    fairly manageable algebraically. You will be expected to be able to work these calculations by 
    hand (with the help of a formula sheet and a calculator, of course).
    
- Class: text
  Output: One place where you will not be expected to work by hand is the normal approximation to
    the binomial distribution.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Suppose you have 100 trials and a probability of success p=0.3. Let's check that this is
    appropriate for the normal approximation. First, what is np?
  CorrectAnswer: np = 100*0.3 = 30
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=30)
  Hint: n=100 and p=0.3
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great, np is greater than 10! Now let's check n(1-p). Find this value now.
  CorrectAnswer: n(1-p) = 100*0.7 = 70
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=70)
  Hint: n=100 and p=0.3
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: np and n(1-p) are both greater than 10, so we're set to jet. What is the mean of the normal 
    distribution that we will use to approximate this binomial distribution? 
  CorrectAnswer: np = 30
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=30)
  Hint: How do we calculate mu for the normal approximation to the binomial distribution?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: What is the standard deviation of the normal distribution that we will use to approximate this 
    binomial distribution? Round your answer to 2 decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(np(1-p)) = 4.58
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=4.58)
  Hint: How do we calculate sigma for the normal approximation to the binomial distribution?
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the normal approximation to our binomial n=100 p=0.3 distribution, we want to find the 
    probability that there are 38 or fewer successes. Remember that we want to improve the approximation
    by modifying our (upper) cutoff value. Find the Z-score for this value. Round your answer to two 
    decimal places.
  CorrectAnswer: (38.5-30)/4.58 = 1.86
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=1.86)
  Hint: We found mu=30 and sigma=4.58 for our normal approximation. For our upper cutoff value, we want 
    to add 0.5, so x will be 38 + 0.5 = 38.5
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the Z-score and the pnorm() command to find the probability that there are 38 or fewer 
    successes. Recall that pnorm(z) will give the left tail area, where you plug your Z-score in for z.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(1.86)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pnorm(1.86)')
  Hint: z = 1.86
  
- Class: text
  Output: If we calculate this using only the binomial distribution, we get a probability of 0.966.
    This is quite close to our normal approximation!

  Output: In order to recieve credit for Lab 6 (8/14/19), raise your hand and ask your TA to confirm 
    that you have reached the end of the Swirl lesson. This will count as your lab grade and 
     attendance for the day.
